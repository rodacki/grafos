    """Compute the number of connected components in an undirected graph using BFS.

    This algorithm follows the style presented in *Introduction to Algorithms*
    (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein â€“ CLRS), where BFS is used to explore
    all vertices reachable from a given source. Each time a new unvisited
    (WHITE) vertex is found, a BFS tree is started, representing a new
    connected component.

    Args:
        graph (Graph): An undirected graph implementing the Graph interface.

    Returns:
        int: The number of connected components in the graph.

    Notes:
        - Original name in Portuguese: **componentes conexas (BFS)**.
        - Uses BFS to explore each component independently.
        - Complexity: O(V + E), where V = number of vertices, E = number of edges.
